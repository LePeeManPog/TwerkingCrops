## Features:
Currently, the plugin provides a function that allows you to grow crops faster with Twerking, twerk in a 3 block radius of your crops and an Area of 3x3 (Your the Middle Point) Will be Bonemealed, Particle effects on the crops will show you which one has been effected!

There is also a Custom Growth Timer, with this function you can set a specified amount of x seconds per Crops to let them grow, so every 60 seconds ALL the carrots in the game will be Grown +1 Grow Stage.

The Randomizer will give a special functionality for a better experience, instead of always having Succes (Crops getting BoneMealed) this function will give it a 20% chance.

- Twerking for Crops/Trees/Cactus/Sugarcane/Mushrooms
- Set Command to set Functions True or False
- Growth Timer for custom growing Times per Crop
